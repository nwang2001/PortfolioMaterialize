      <h2>Professional Development</h2>
      <p>Throughout the Gateway program, I've came to the realization that it has parallels to what I learned in my
        previous business and JROTC classes. It became evident that the foundational skills I acquired in those classes,
        such as presentation skills and proper communication etiquette, became the bedrock that Gateway built upon.
        Another realization I made during the Gateway experience was the immense importance of self-discipline and time
        management. The program encouraged us to take charge of our own learning and development, and it became clear
        that
        our success depended heavily on our ability to manage our time effectively and stay focused on our goals.
        Attending the Blacks in Tech career fair and stopping at the Road to Hire table allowed me to gain a deeper
        understanding of the program's structure. I realized Road to Hire and the Gateway program is not just about us
        acquiring technical skills, but it also places emphasis on personal growth and professional development. I
        believe
        this program will be a remarkable opportunity for personal and professional growth.</p>

      <h2>Technical</h2>
      <p>Before the Gateway process started, I was advised to brush up on my HTML and CSS. This preparation proved
        beneficial as I tackled the HTML and CSS assignments. It became evident that I possessed the necessary skills,
        but
        to truly excel and become more efficient, I needed to devote more time to practice. While watching the video
        tutorials provided a foundation, I understood that deep understanding of the subjects taught required active
        engagement. I had to use additional resources to conduct further research and experiment on my own to ensure I
        comprehend the concepts correctly. One feature of web developement I struggled to learn is media queries. I
        didn't
        understand its usage and when to use it. After learning about it in Gateway and conducting further research, I
        was
        able to grasp a better understanding and use it in this project. I like that at the end of his videos, Mr.
        McNeil
        will have his slide that says "practice makes progress" and I agree with it. As technology evolves, it's
        beneficial to have a growth mindset and stay open to continuous learning. Through consistent practice, I can
        make
        tangible progress in my technical skills.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Personal</h2>
      <p>I realized that I still have the same fascination with coding as I did in high school. The world of coding is
        vast and complex, with numerous coding languages to explore. While it can be frustrating at times, the sense of
        accomplishment when the code works is very rewarding. I enjoy making websites more appealing and visually
        engaging. To me, the process of transforming a blank code page into a functional and aesthetically pleasing
        website is incredibly fulfilling. I also appreciate the opportunity to learn new coding elements and later
        applying them to my projects. As I reflect on my Gateway experience, I am grateful for the opportunity to learn
        more about coding and web development.</p>
