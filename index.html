        Hello everyone, my name is Nikki Wang. I am the eldest and only daughter out of three kids. I was born in Lower
        Manhattan but I don't consider myself a New Yorker. I have moved around quite a bit. I've lived in New York,
        China, Illinois, Virginia, and now North Carolina, in that order. I've lived in cities most of my life but I
        prefer rural areas with less traffic.
      </p>

        I've been told I'm an animate person and I agree, I make a lot of facial expressions. After I get comfortable, I
        can talk a lot. I'm naturally curious and asks questions. I have many hobbies and projects that I work on in my
        freetime. Recently, I picked up crocheting and embroidery. I like arts and crafts. I think art is a form of self
        expression. I also like creating things and I find it rewarding getting the final project.
      </p>

        I graduated high school in Charlotte. I actually first learned about computer science in high school. I
        was placed in a computer programming class. The first language I learned was Visual Basic. After finishing the
        code, I would change the visual aspects and add color to my projects. I ended up enjoying coding and continued
        to
        attend similar classes. I graduated in 2020, so I didn't have an actual graduation or much of a senior
        experience.
        After high school, I went to college for computer science. I was a first-generation college student and it was
        intimidating navigating it myself. Unfortunately, college didn't work out due to personal reasons. Although
        college didn't work out, I want to continue to pursue a career in computer programming and learn more.
